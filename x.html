<p>The algorithms shown in 2-3-4-trees ensure a tree structure that is always balanced, but a 2-3-4 tree wastes storage because its 3-node and 4-nodes are not always full. A red black tree is a way of representing a 2 3 4 tree as a nearlybalanced binary search tree.</p>
<p>&quot;Every 2-, 3-, and 4-node in a 2 3 4 tree can be converted to at least 1 black node and 1 or 2 red children of the black node. Red nodes are always ones that would join with their parent to become a 3- or 4-node in a 2-3-4 tree&quot; from <a href="http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/cs104/slides/L19b_BalancedBST_BTreeRB.pdf" class="uri">http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/cs104/slides/L19b_BalancedBST_BTreeRB.pdf</a> slide 45.</p>
<p>These links have good explanations of red black trees and how to transform the nodes of a 2-3-4 tree into red black tree:</p>
