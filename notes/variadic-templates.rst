Variadic Templates
==================

Articles on implementing C++ Variadic Templates:

In addition to variadic function template examples, `Variadic templates in C++ <https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/variadic-templates-in-c/>`_ has an excellent example of how ``std::tuple`` can be implemented as a variadic data structure.
As the article explains:

    Variadic templates make it possible to define data structures that could have an arbitrary number of fields, and have this number configured per use. The prime example of this is a tuple class, and here I want to show how to construct one...

The code for the tuple implementation given in the article is at https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/master/2014/variadic-tuple.cpp.
