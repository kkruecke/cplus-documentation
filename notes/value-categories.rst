C++11 introduced the concept of (an expression's) **value category**, which the article `Value Categories <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category>`_ at en.cppreference.com explains

    Each C++ expression (an operator with its operands, a literal, a variable name, etc.) is characterized by two independent properties: a type and a value category.
    Each expression has some non-reference type, and each expression belongs to exactly one of the three primary value categories: prvalue, xvalue, and lvalue...

Some examples of expressions:

.. code-block:: cpp

    x = 42; // Assignment expression
    
    42; // An expression as well, with no side effects
    
    int a; // A declaration statement (not an expression)
    
    int b = fun(42); // A declaration statement with an expression initializer
                     // fun(42) is an expression

* An **lvalue** (so-called, historically, because lvalues could appear on the left-hand side of an assignment expression) designates a function or an object. [Example: If E is an expression of pointer type, then \*E is an lvalue expression referring to the object or function to which E points. As another example, the result of calling a function whose return type is an lvalue reference is an lvalue.]
* An **xvalue** (an “eXpiring” value) also refers to an object, usually near the end of its lifetime (so that its resources may be moved, for example). An xvalue is the result of certain kinds of expressions involving rvalue references. [Example: The result of calling a function whose return type is an rvalue reference is an xvalue.]
* A **glvalue** (“generalized” lvalue) is an lvalue or an xvalue.
* An **rvalue** (so-called, historically, because rvalues could appear on the right-hand side of an assignment expression) is an xvalue, a temporary object or subobject thereof, or a value that is not associated with an object.
* A **prvalue** (“pure” rvalue) is an rvalue that is not an xvalue. [Example: The result of calling a function whose return type is not a reference is a prvalue]

On page 165 of `The C++ Programming Language 4th Edition <https://smile.amazon.com/Programming-Language-hardcover-4th/dp/0321958322/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?crid=47A4W3MV3W0Y&keywords=the+c%2B%2B+programming+language+hardcover+4th+edition&qid=1553447852&s=gateway&sprefix=the+c%2B%2B+prog%2Caps%2C206&sr=8-1-fkmrnull>`_,
Stroustrup explains what *lvalue* means:

    *lvalue* orignally meant an expression that can be on the left-hand side of an assignment. However, this is obviously not true of a *const* object. Note also, that object in this context refers to the low-level notion of "something
    in memory" and not to the notion of class object.

On page 166, he explains the term *rvalue* and elaborates on the differences between *lvalues* and *rvalues*:
 
    An *object* is a contiguous region of storage of storage; an *lvalue* is an expression that refers to an object....To complement the notion of an *lvalue*, we have the notion of an *rvalue* such as a temporary (e.g. the value returned from
    a function).

    There are two properties that matter for an object when it comes to addressing, copying and moving:

    * *Has Identity*: The program has the name of, address of, or reference to the object so that it is possible to determine if two objects are the same, whether the value has changed, etc.
    * *Movable*: the object may be moved from (i.e. we are allowed to move its value to another location and leave the object in a valid but unspecified state, rather than copying).

    It turns out that three of the four possibilities of these two properites are needed to precisely describe the C++ language rules (we have no need for object that do not have identity and cannot be moved). Using "**m**
    for movable" and "**i** for has identity", we can represent this classification of expressions graphically:

.. figure:: ../images/value-categories.jpg
   :alt: value categories
   :align: center 
   :scale: 100 %
   :figclass: custom-figure

   **Figure: value categories** 
..

    So, a classical lvalue is something that has identity and cannot be moved (because we could examine it after the move), and a classical rvalue is anything that we are allowed to move from. The other alternatives 
    are *prvalue* ("pure rvalue"), *glvalue* ("generalized lvalue"), and *xvalue* ("x" for "extraordinary"). For example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void f(vector<stinrg>& vs)
    {
         vector<string>& v2 = std::move(vs);
    }

..

    Here ``std::move(vs)`` is an xvalue: it clearly has idenity (we can refer to it as ``vs``), but we have explicitly given permission for it to be moved from by calling ``std::move()``.
    
    For praictical programming, thinking in terms of rvalue and lvalue is usually sufficient. Note that every expression is either an lvalue or an rvalue, but not both.
