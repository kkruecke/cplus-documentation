CSS Techniques
++++++++++++++

How to add custom css for inline code to sphinx-generated html. Seehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10870719/inline-code-highlighting-in-restructuredtext
which says:

    To get syntax highlighting you can define a custom role. For example
    
    .. role:: bash(code)
       :language: bash
    
    which you can then use like so:
    
    Here is some awesome bash code :bash:`a = b + c`.
    
How to add an extra css is explained at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23462494/how-to-add-a-custom-css-file
which says:

    A simpler way is to add this to your conf.py:
    
    def setup(app):
        app.add_stylesheet('css/custom.css')
    
    Then put the file into the _static/css/ folder.
